I have decided to use console.log instead of alert so you have to use a web or dev console to get all out of this code. try to cut, copy and paste some of this stuff.

then hover the mouse over the third textfield and see the coordinates (topleft to bottom right) changing. they are relative to the second field, which is an iframe, but not exactly known if center, topleft or what. horizontal is x, vertical is y.
